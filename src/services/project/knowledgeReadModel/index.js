/**
 * knowledgeReadModel — public entry (v1, offline candidate).
 *
 * Read-only, in-process knowledge query capability. The trusted application
 * boundary assembles an authorized frozen snapshot and calls queryKnowledge.
 * Nothing here writes, switches worldbooks, calls providers, or registers
 * provider tools. Integration into product flows is I0's job — this module
 * has zero production importers by design (night track K, 2026-09-05).
